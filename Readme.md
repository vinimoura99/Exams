# Exams

The **Exams** folder contains the final projects for the 42 School curriculum. Each project corresponds to an **exam rank**, where each exam tests a different set of skills and programming concepts in C, C++, and system-level programming.

## ðŸŽ¯ Exam Structure

### **Exam Rank 2: Libft**
- **Objective**: Implement your own C library, `libft`, with commonly used functions like string manipulation, memory allocation, and more.
- **Focus**: Memory management, C standard library functions, and creating reusable utilities.
- **Skills Tested**: 
  - Memory management (`malloc`, `free`)
  - String manipulation
  - Data structures and algorithms

### **Exam Rank 3: ft_printf or Get Next Line**
- **Objective**:
  - **`ft_printf`**: Recreate the `printf` function, handling different types of format specifiers.
  - **`Get Next Line`**: Implement `get_next_line()` to read one line from a file descriptor at a time.
- **Focus**: Formatted output or file I/O.
- **Skills Tested**: 
  - Variable argument handling (`printf`)
  - Efficient file I/O and memory management (`get_next_line`)

### **Exam Rank 4: Minishell**
- **Objective**: Create a simple shell program that mimics basic shell functionality like command execution, piping, and redirection.
- **Focus**: Process control, system calls, and handling shell commands.
- **Skills Tested**:
  - Process creation and management (`fork()`, `exec()`)
  - Shell input/output redirection
  - Signal handling and command parsing

### **Exam Rank 5: C++ (up to C++03)**
- **Objective**: Transition from C to C++ by implementing object-oriented solutions using classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Focus**: Object-oriented programming and memory management in C++.
- **Skills Tested**: 
  - Class design and abstraction
  - Memory management in C++ (`new`, `delete`)
  - Operator overloading and inheritance

### **Exam Rank 6: Miniserver**
- **Objective**: Build a simple HTTP web server that can handle client requests, serve files, and manage connections.
- **Focus**: Networking, system-level programming, and HTTP protocols.
- **Skills Tested**:
  - Socket programming and handling client-server communication
  - HTTP request parsing and response generation
  - Multi-client handling and concurrency

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone and Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vinimoura99/42core.git
cd 42core/Exams
make
````

This will compile all the exam tasks for **Rank 2**, **Rank 3**, **Rank 4**, **Rank 5**, and **Rank 6**.

### 2. Example Usage

```c
#include "exam_utils.h"

int main(void)
{
    // Example usage for Rank 2 - Libft
    rank_2_libft();
    return 0;
}
```

Compile your program with:

```bash
gcc main.c -Iincludes -o exam_program
```

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

* **Rank 2**: Low-level programming, memory management, and creating utility functions.
* **Rank 3**: Formatted output and file I/O handling.
* **Rank 4**: System-level programming, creating a shell, process management, and redirection.
* **Rank 5**: Object-oriented programming in C++.
* **Rank 6**: Networking, HTTP protocols, and building a simple web server.

---

## ðŸ“œ Notes

* Each exam rank has its own focus and difficulty level, starting from basic C skills (Rank 2) to advanced topics like multi-threading and web servers (Rank 6).
* **Rank 2** and **Rank 3** are heavily focused on C, while **Rank 5** and **Rank 6** introduce C++ and system-level programming concepts.
* All exams must be done individually and within a specified time limit.
