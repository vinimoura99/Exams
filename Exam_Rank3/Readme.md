🏆 42 Exam Rank 3 – Level 1 & Level 2
☑️ Level 1 – I/O and Parsing Fundamentals
Exercise 1 – Broken GNL

Objective: Debug and complete a defective version of get_next_line to read from stdin line by line, ensuring:

Correct reading until \n

Proper handling of EOF

Correct buffer and memory management

Exercise 2 – Filter

Objective: Create a program filter.c that:

Reads from stdin line by line

Prints only lines that contain a keyword (passed as argv[1])

Uses only allowed functions (read, write, and custom functions)

Exercise 3 – Scanf

Objective: Implement a simplified version of scanf capable of:

Reading from stdin

Parsing integers (%d), strings (%s), and characters (%c)

Storing values in variables passed by reference

☑️ Level 2 – Recursion, Combinatorics and Algorithms
Exercise 4 – Nqueens

Objective: Solve the N queens problem using backtracking:

Place N queens on an NxN board

Ensure no queen attacks another (rows, columns, diagonals)

Print all possible solutions

Exercise 5 – Powerset

Objective: Generate all subsets of a given set:

Use recursion

Print all subsets, including the empty set []

Example: {1,2,3} → [], [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3]

Exercise 6 – Permutations

Objective: Generate all permutations of distinct elements:

Use recursion with swapping

Example: {1,2,3} → [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]

Exercise 7 – Tsq

Objective: Solve a specific algorithmic task (exam-defined):

Efficient data manipulation

Logic and optimization practice

Exercise 8 – Rip

Objective: System-level programming exercise (exam-defined):

Focus on low-level reasoning

Pointer manipulation and memory handling
