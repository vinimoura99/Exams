Expected files: basic_recursion.c
Allowed functions: printf, write
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that demonstrates basic recursion.

Your program will take one argument: a number n.
Print all numbers from 1 to n using recursion.

For example:
$> ./basic_recursion 5
1 2 3 4 5

NOTES:
- Use recursion instead of loops
- Handle the case when n is 0 or negative
- Print numbers separated by spaces
- Return 0 on success, 1 on error

HINT: This teaches you the basics of recursion
